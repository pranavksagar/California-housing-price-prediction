# California-housing-price-prediction

A regression task of predicting housing values has been explored using various algorithms such as Linear regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. 

# Preprocessing the data

The initial part of the project is to preprocess the data which has 10 attributes, and visualise the housing price data. Feature scaling of the data was one of the important steps in pre processing

# Selecting a model

Different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees and Random forests were tried and compared on the pre processed data

# Fine tuning the model

Grid search was used to fine tune the model where the results on the test data were found to be having RMSE of $47,766 with housing values lying between $120k and $265k
